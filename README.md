### Running the Examples

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/petsereypanha/basic-java.git
   cd java-basic
   ```

2. **Compile a Java file**
   ```bash
   javac src/basic/Firstprogram.java
   ```

3. **Run the compiled class**
   ```bash
   java -cp src basic.Firstprogram
   ```

4. **Or use your IDE**
   - Open the project in your IDE
   - Navigate to any Java file with a `main` method
   - Right-click and select "Run"

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with `src/basic/` - Learn fundamental Java syntax
2. Move to `src/control_statement/` - Understand program flow
3. Practice with `src/loop/` - Master iteration
4. Explore `src/array/` - Work with data structures
5. Study `src/function/` - Learn modular programming
6. Deep dive into `src/oop/` - Master object-oriented concepts
7. Experiment with `src/collection/` - Use Java collections
8. Build GUIs with `src/awt/`, `src/swing/`, and `src/form/` - Create user interfaces

## 🛠️ IDE Setup

### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Select "Open" and choose the `java-basic` folder
3. Wait for the project to index
4. Right-click any file with a main method and select "Run"

### Visual Studio Code
